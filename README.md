### Philosophy
Animal Quarantine is looking for a solution to assist with the heavy traffic and long lines of people coming to pick up their Hawaii inbound animals.  COVID-19 has added more complications to an already unwieldy process in that no pet owners can enter the quarantine building.  This causes owners to stand outside waiting to hear their name called on the intercom.  There is no place to wait and there isn’t protection from the sun.  We are hoping for a method to allow owners to use their smartphones to communicate their arrivals and receive a text or alert when their pet is ready to be picked up.
