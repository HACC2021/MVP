# Sheets Setup Guide

This guide walks through how to enable access to programmatically query the Google Sheets API. This step is required to serve form responses on the `http://localhost:5000/data` route locally.

## End State
* A `google-credentials.json` and a `token.json` file generated at the root of this project's file structure
* The `http://localhost:5000/data` returning a result of the following form

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have access to the team Google Account (`HACCMVP2021@gmail.com`)
> Credentials are available in Slack (team channel)
2. Retrieve and save the `google-credentials.json` file in the root of this project's file structure (also in Slack team channel)

Your file structure should look like
```
...
src/
public/
scripts/
google-credentials.json # <- Save to right here!
```
3. Run the [sheets setup script](../../scripts/sheetsInit.js)
> Example: `node scripts/sheetsInit.js`

You should be prompted with the following prompt:

4. Click the link and authorize the app by signing into the team Google account
> This should redirect you to the `http://localhost:5000` domain

5. Copy the code from the url
> The redirected url should look something like `http://localhost:5000?code=...&client_id=...`
> 
> The generated code from the URL may contain special URL encoded characters.  
> So go to https://www.urldecoder.io/ and decode the string, then paste it back into the terminal.
> Make sure you do not copy the `&` symbol, as that is not apart of the code.

6. Enter that code into your terminal awaiting prompt, and your `token.json` file should now be generated

Your resulting file structure should look like
```
...
src/
public/
scripts/
google-credentials.json
token.json # <- Generated right here!
```
